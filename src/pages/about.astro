						<p>Independent Arts is a creative studio supporting Nigerian artists through research, funding, and resources. We help bring passion projects to life by providing grants, production support, and press coverage.</p>
						<p>We believe that passion projects are vital to our cultural future. Founded by Opemipo Aikomo in 2021, we've invested over $100,000 in commissions, supporting dozens of artists in bringing their creative visions to life.</p>
						<p>Our mission is to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>1. Fund creative projects that nurture emerging talent</li>
							<li>2. Connect local artists to global ideas and people</li>
							<li>3. Contribute to the documentation of new culture</li>
							<li>4. Produce events to celebrate excellent work</li>
						</ul>
						<p>IA is run by <a href="https://moonlight.ng">Moonlight</a> and managed by Williams Ogah. We're based in Lagos and operate globally.</p>
