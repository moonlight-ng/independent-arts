We're excited to announce a significant update to Cover Bank, our digital archive of over 5,300 Nigerian album covers spanning from the 1950s to present day.

The latest update brings a more intuitive browsing experience with improved filters now prominently displayed at the top of the page. This enhancement makes it easier to explore covers by designer, genre, artist, and more.

This update is just the beginning of our efforts to build an engaged community around Nigerian graphic design history. Whether you're a researcher, designer, or music enthusiast, we hope these improvements help you discover and appreciate the rich visual heritage of Nigerian music.
