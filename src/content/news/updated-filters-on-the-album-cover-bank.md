We've launched a significant update to Cover Bank, a digital archive showcasing over 5,300 Nigerian album covers from the 1950s to date.

Weâ€™re excited to share a revamped filter experience that makes navigating the archive more intuitive. We've brought out filters to the top of the page, making it easier to access.

With this feature, our goal is to make it easier to find a cover. This is the start of our efforts to build an engaged community around the archive.
